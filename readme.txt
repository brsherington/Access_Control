Description:
  This is an attempted program to understand and check access control. There are two main files, get.c and put.c.
  The purpose of get is to retrieve the .access file and check it against a real_id of the user and that it has
  the correct permissions. The idea of put is to then take the created destination file and place it back.
  By running the makefile the programs compile and are able to be run.
